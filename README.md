# **🎨 Hangman 12+ – The Coolest Hangman Game Ever!**

Think Hangman is just another boring word game? **Think again.**

This isn't your average Hangman game. **This is Sketchy Hangman.** ✏️  
✔️ **Hand-drawn, sketchy UI** that makes it feel straight out of a notebook  
✔️ **Dynamic, modular Hangman drawing** – because not all Hangmen are built the same  
✔️ **12+ Age Rating** – because only the skilled survive  
✔️ **Serverless & Unhackable** – nice try, cheaters 😏

## **🚀 Why is This Game So Awesome?**

🔥 **The UI is straight-up art** – Every stroke looks hand-drawn, making it _feel_ like you’re playing on paper  
🔥 **It's fast, responsive, and buttery smooth** – Built with cutting-edge tech (React + Vite)  
🔥 **Hints toggler** – Because we’re not all spelling bee champions
🔥 **Pure skill, no shortcuts** – It’s **serverless**, but you still can’t outsmart this code

<!-- 🔥 **Mobile-friendly** – Play it anywhere, anytime   -->

## **🛠️ Tech Stack (For the Nerds 🤓)**

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, CSS
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## **🎮 How to Dominate This Game**

📝 **Step 1:** Look at the hidden word and panic  
🤔 **Step 2:** Guess letters and pray you’re right  
😨 **Step 3:** Watch the Hangman appear with every wrong guess  
🏆 **Step 4:** Flex when you win (or rage when you lose)

💡 **Pro Tip:** Use the hint button if you’re struggling – no judgment (maybe a little).
